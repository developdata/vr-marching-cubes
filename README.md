3D VR Marching Cubes
=================

An implemention of the Marching Cubes algorithm in Three.js and A-Frame


Information
------------

### References
The code was based on this [code](https://github.com/timoxley/threejs/blob/master/examples/webgl_marching_cubes.html)
There are some good examples of implementation of the marching cube algorithm in Three.js [here](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/#metabubbles) 
The code for the meta bubbles is [here](https://github.com/stemkoski/stemkoski.github.com/blob/master/Three.js/Metabubbles.html)

### current state
There is a working version of the marching cubes metaballs in A-Frame. It still needs some work, but the basics
are there.

### Files
The current version is in the index.html file. It uses MeshForm.js and MarchCube.js to form the meshes.

I have kept the code from different stages in the 03 - 06_move_to_vr.html, there are a number of 
javascript files with different versions to match them
01_time_version.html is a working version of the marching cubes in three.js, its uses the MarchingCube.library
02_stemkoski_verison.html doesn't yet work on this site as the links are wrong
